## üçïPizza Maker
Sample of an evolving MVI based arch.
The functionality involves choosing various options for customizing a pizza.


### The Examples
There are two examples with the same (albeit cosmetically different) functionality: 
1. `mvi` - Using `Fragment`s, [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding), [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) 
2. `mvijetpackcompose` - Using the `0.1.0-dev01` [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) artifacts. Prone to instability at the moment (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/dggpqy/jetpack_compose_binaries_are_now_available_to/f3bktsf/)). Last built & run with Android Studio `3.5.1` with no breaking issues.
