## üçïPizza Maker
Sample of an evolving MVI based arch.
The functionality involves choosing various options for customizing a pizza.


### The Examples
There are two examples with similar (albeit cosmetically different) functionality: 
1. `mvi` - Using `Fragment`s, [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding), [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started).

2. `mvijetpackcompose` - Using the `1.0.0-alpha05` version of [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup).
